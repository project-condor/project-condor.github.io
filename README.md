# Project Condor

Project Condor regroups several smaller projects with the aim of creating a fully open source quadcopter.

The goals are:

- A large (1m diameter frame), powerful quadcopter.
- Modular, rack-like design that enables easy addition and removal of modules (e.g. camera, on board computer, extra batteries)
- Self-assemblable flight controller using readily available components
- Operation from a computer-based interface
